Dual port RAM can be written and read simultaneously. 

This special type of RAM has two unidirectional data ports 
- an input port for writing data and
- an output port for reading data.

Each port has its own data and address buses.
- the write port has a signal called 'write' to allow writing the data
- the read port has a signal called 'read' to enable the data output.
Both reading and writing data occur on the rising clock edge
